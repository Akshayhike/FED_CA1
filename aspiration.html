                <!-- Challenge content -->
                <p class="challenge-text">Embarking on a zero-waste lifestyle can definitely throw some curveballs my way. I've found that breaking old habits of
                convenience, like automatically reaching for a disposable coffee cup, is a real challenge, and it's not always easy to
                find those package-free personal care items or bulk food options here in Singapore, which sometimes means I have to plan
                my shopping trips more carefully. Plus, asking for no straw or bringing my own container for dabao can feel a little
                awkward at first! Figuring out how to repair something instead of just buying new often means learning a new skill.
                However, overcoming these hurdles is totally doable: I keep my reusables visible to build new habits, actively explore
                local bulk stores and online options for products, find that confidence and a polite smile help in social situations,
                and rely on online tutorials or local repair shops to fix items. Every small win, every item saved from the bin, feels
                like a huge victory, keeping me motivated to continue on this journey</p>

            </div>

                <!-- Overcome heading -->
                <h1 class="challenge-heading">How I will overcome these challenges</h1>

                <!-- Overcome content -->
                 <p class="challenge-text">Overcoming these hurdles is totally doable. For those tricky habits, it's all about preparation: I keep my reusable
                bags, water bottle, and coffee cup right by the door or in my everyday bag so I never forget them. When it comes to
                finding those elusive package-free items, I've started exploring local spots like UnPackt or The Green Collective, and
                sometimes even ordering in bulk online. For the social aspect, I've learned that a polite smile and confidence go a long
                way, most hawkers and restaurant staff are actually quite understanding. And for repairs? YouTube tutorials are my best
                friend for simple fixes, and I'm always on the lookout for local repair cafes. Every small win, every item saved from
                the bin, feels like a huge victory, and that keeps me going!</p>
